By: Nicholas Carsello, Nickolas Kusman, Patrick Maxwell, Michael Woelfel

Introduction:
The purpose of the matching game is so that people can challenge their memory. Playing memory games can help stimulate one’s brain and improve their critical thinking skills. They can choose their level of difficulty from 1-3. This is an Android game that people can play on their Android devices.

Objectives:
Create matching game that takes in user input to make a board size (Must be even number and no larger than 8x8 but no smaller than 4x4).

How to play the game
When the user opens the app the main screen will appear where they can choose the size of the board. They will then get the option if they want to play with a timer or not. Once in the game they will select two cards and if they match they will be removed. If they don’t match they will be flipped back over. When the game ends it will display the amount of time they had left if they won, and say “Time’s up. You lose” if they run out of time.The game will then return to the menu for them to play again.

Nonfunctional Requirements: 
  1. The colors be nice to the eye - not too bright, not to dim, and not a bad contrast.
  2. The font should be sized to fit the users screen
  3. Must have almost instantaneous response time
  4. Internet connection would not be necessary as everything would be included in the application and code.
