# Comp330GroupProjectMatchingGame
Matching Game implementation for our code


How to play:
>Compiling the program will begin the matching game. The game will provide a grid structure, of which you can use your mouse to interact with the GUI. The game is based on a memory game, so the goal will be to match all of the correct cards with one another.
